## Deep Learning
My Favorite Area in AI is Deep Learning, I Start With Algorithms paper Like [ANT Colony](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=ant%20colony%20optimization%20deep%20learning) And When Learn More In ML Learn Deep Learning. At First I Use Persian Resources Then Switch To English Resource After Testing A lot Resources There Is My Favorite Resource To Learn Deep Learning.
